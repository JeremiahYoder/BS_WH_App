Candidate Programming Assignment
Baylor Scott & White Health

Task
Create a React Native application using Typescript and a state management library (preferably Redux) that shows a list of people.  The user should be able to tap on an individual item and see the complete details of any person.  This assignment contains 2 User Stories that must be implemented. All your code should be type safe. Dispatch all actions to the Redux (or other) store.

User Story 1
As a mobile user, I want the ability to see a quickly viewable list all our users.

Acceptance Criteria
Display First and Last Name
Display user’s email address

Technical Story (Optional, but recommended)

Implement a native module in iOS (Swift/Objective-C) or Android (Kotlin/Java).  This native module can do anything that you choose, but it must be demonstratable. 

Requirements
The application must be developed in React Native.
A state-management library must be used.
The user stories must be 100% complete.

User Interface Design Considerations
The above UI screenshots are meant as a guide for the user interface. They show the bare minimum of what the user interface should display.
You have free reign on how you want the user interface to look like.
Feel free to change the following UI components:
Typography
Colors
Animations
Be creative! 
Other Considerations
This assignment should be treated as if this were to be published on Google Play and Apple App Stores.
Consider how you would design this application for:
Testability
Network connection reliability
Screen orientation changes
Unexpected user data

Project Submission
Create a zip file that includes your project.
Push project to a public GitHub repository
Notify Darrell.Davis@bswhealth.org the GitHub repo location.
Minimize repo size by only pushing necessary artifacts.
When you schedule your in-house interview, please bring your computer to interview so that we can go over your code and ask you questions.
If you’re unable to bring a computer, let us know and we’ll let you borrow one for demonstration purposes.

Good luck and we look forward to reviewing your submission! :)
